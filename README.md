# img2ascii
This was created for the Clemson CUHACKIT 2024 hackathon. The website allows you to upload an image, choose a scaling factor (resizes the image), then generates ASCII art from the uploaded image. You also have the option to save the resulting ASCII to a text file or copy it to your device clipboard. The project was made with Python (for the ASCII conversion and Flask backend) and HTML/CSS (for the simple frontend).

## Guided Install/Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://grossmannjenna/ASCII2img`
2. Change to the ASCII2img directory: `cd ASCII2img` 
3. Install the necessary packages with pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
4. Run the Flask server: `python flask_app.py`
